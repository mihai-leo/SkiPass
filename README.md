 This application streamlines the process of selling ski passes and facilitates the
 borrowing of skiing equipment. When purchasing a ski pass, the buyer can choose from three
 options: PointPass, DayPass, or HourPass. Additionally, users have the option to borrow skiing
 equipment. The application prompts users to input their sizes, checks the stock, and displays a
 message if the desired equipment is unavailable. Upon purchase, the stock is updated
 accordingly.
 When creating a ski pass, the application requests the following information from the
 buyer:- Name- Phone number (used as a unique identifier for the ski pass)- Quantity (points/hours/days) desired- Preferred equipment
 Before adding a ski pass, the app verifies if the provided phone number is already
 associated with a pass. If a match is found, a message is displayed to inform the user.
 The application also includes functionality to delete a ski pass using the buyer's phone
 number. If the ski pass is not found, a corresponding message is displayed. Borrowed
 equipment is listed, and the stock is updated accordingly.
 A scan function checks if a pass is still active. For PointPass, it verifies if the points
 remaining are greater than 0. For HourPass and DayPass, it checks if the current time or date is
 earlier than their respective end times.
 The application provides a function for extending Point and Hour passes. Upon
 successful purchase or extension, the price is displayed without errors.
